# migae examples

The `lein` subdirectory contains non-gae and gae examples using leiningen.

The `maven` subdirectory contains gae examples using, yes, maven
rather than leiningen.  The new maven build system for GAE addresses
most of the issues that the migae template and plugin were designed to
address.  New projects should use maven.
